This is The ESPSmartClock8266 Without it's case (3D Printed Case File Will Be Uploaded)

**How it works:** The ESPSmartClock8266 works by connecting the ESP8266 to Wi-Fi checking the time from an NTP server and displaying it on the LED Matrix display. <br/>
                  In the future, there will be an app that can customize the display or set up an alarm. But for now, you can only use an IR remote<br/>
                  Currently, It's powered by a 18560 Li-Ion battery but in the future, there will be a version that will be powered by wall power.<br/>
